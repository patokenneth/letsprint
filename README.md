/* A quick and important note: for the purpose of this project, Albelli has five product types: photoBook, calendar, canvas, set of greeting cards and mug.
I have implemented this types as enums. Hence, when running this project on Swagger, ensure that the ProductType you enter is between 0 - 4. It does not
accept a string or anything above 4. Well, I already implemented checks to guard against bad data. So... It's up to you.*/


# letsprint
This is a project I created for Albelli .NET position.

## Description

Albelli's vision is to brighten up the world by bringing peopleâ€™s moments to life. Essentially, they help people relive their best and lovely moments 
through personalised photo products. In this project, I have built a web API to simulate the process of making orders on Albelli's platform and also
the ability to retrieve the order details using the OrderID.

## Getting Started
This project is on my github repo and has two branches: main and Dev. Start by cloning the main branch of the repo. Afterwards, restore the NuGet packages 
and run migration (that is, add-migration --name). The solution has two projects: the main project called letsprint and the test project named letsprint_test.
If you have followed the instructions above, the solution should start up on swagger when you run it.
